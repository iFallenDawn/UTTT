# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe (UTTT)
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a variation of Tic Tac Toe that needs a lot more thinking

## Contributors
This was made during the school year of 2018-2019 by Jordan Wang (iFallenDawn) and Elijah Paul (eg-paul).
One of the games that came out of our development process, where I made a working two player game with basic GUI/logic, and Eli made the AI.
I became the front end dev, Eli was the back end dev.

## Rules
Win three games of Tic Tac Toe in a row.
You may only play in the big field that
corresponds to the last small field your
opponent played. When your are sent to a
field that is already decided, you can
choose freely.
